with ems, if you are doing at font-size property,it looks at the parent
but if you do at any other property like padding and margin,it no longer kooks at the parent instead it looks at the font size of the the element
 /* em is relative to the font-size
       of this element */ 
       
       
.button {
    display: inline-block;
    background: #FFE600;
    color: black;
    padding: .5em 1.25em;
    /* em is relative to the font-size
       of this element means button element */
    text-align: center;
    text-decoration: none;
    margin-bottom: 50px;
}
