/* flex basis sets height when display set to row and it's set width when display set to column*/
    
    
    but in this example if we set flexbasis on imagge flex bssis wont work. it's end up wit the bug 
    to fix this we have set min height:o and min-width:0
    if we set flex basis on image if we have problem alwasy set min-height:0 and min-width:0 to fix this
    
    .card-img {
    object-fit: cover;
    flex-basis: 200px;
    min-width: 0;
    min-height: 0;
    
    background: yellow;
