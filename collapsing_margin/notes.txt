<!--
    collapsing margin--
    by default, margins collapse into one another..
    so if one element has a margin-bottom:50px,and the next one has a margin-top of 50px,the space between them will be 50px and not 100px.
    eg
    p {
    font-size: 18px;
    margin-bottom: 100px;
    
}

    .links {
    margin-top: 150px;
}
betwenn two of them the bigger one will win in this case links's margin-top:150px will win

<!-- 
    collapsing margins have a few situations where they cause problems..
    margins will collapse any time they touch each other.So if the first child in an element has a margin-top,that can merge with the parent's margin-top..
    
    .card {
    background: #000;
    color: white;
    width: 560px;
    margin: 0 auto;
    
}

h1 {
    font-size: 24px;
    margin-top: 100px;
}
in this case h1 is the 1st child of card, if we add the margin-top on h1 to move it down, it moves whole card element down bcz the margin-top of the h1 is merging with card' margin.. but we can avoid this just by adding a padding to parent element in this case to card
e.g

    .card {
    background: #000;
    color: white;
    width: 560px;
    margin: 0 auto;
    padding:5px;
    
    h1 {
    font-size: 24px;
    margin-top: 100px;
}
