margin and padding consistency::
...................................
for consistency, often we  turn off the margin-top on typography related elements
that way we can use padding on the parent, and know that exact spacing that we will have and can keep all sides consistent
also,when we get into layouts with flexbox and grid margins no longer collapse,so this helps us stay more consistent.

that could be painful,but we can include all the elemens in one selector like this
h1,h2,h3,p{
    margin-top:0
}
