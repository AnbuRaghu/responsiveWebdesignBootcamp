::before :: after
  <h2 class="section-title">We can do all sorts of great stuff</h2>
  
  before sudo element doesn't add an element, after h2 element,it adds before the content for example if i add like this
  
  .section-title::after {
    content: "abc";
    display: block;
}

it wont add abc after h2 tag like this
  <h2 class="section-title">We can do all sorts of great stuff</h2>
  abc
  
  but like ths
    <h2 class="section-title"> We can do all sorts of great stuff  abc </h2>
  
  
  
  like wise for ::before too
  
  
   .section-title::before {
    content: "abc";
    display: block;
}

it wont add abc before h2 tag like this

  abc
  <h2 class="section-title">We can do all sorts of great stuff</h2>


 but like ths
    <h2 class="section-title"> abc  We can do all sorts of great stuff  </h2>
