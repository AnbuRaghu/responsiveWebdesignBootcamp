over-writing and applying inheritance
----------------------------------------

Links usually don't inherit their parents color, eventhough other inline elements like em and strong do.
inks have default style on them, setting their color to blue, with the text decoration giving them the underline
they do inherit other properties such as font-size and font-weight

*heading by default don't inherit font-weight property bcz by default they are bold. once again you can overwrite it if you want
