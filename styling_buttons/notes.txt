inline-block
...................
sometimes we need something which can stay inline,but which we can set margins and padding on
most common case is to create a button


styling buttons:
--------------------------
1. put the class directly on your link
2. always use padding to create the 'size' of the button and not width and height


padding left and right needs to be a bigger number than the padding on the top and bottom
in generel,kevin uses a 1:2.5 ratio for the top and sides..but it really depends on the button
