css-Relative units
-----------------------
Relative units are always relative either to a font-size or the size of view port.
for those which are relative to a font-size,which font-size they are relative to depends on a few things,which complicate matters


* The em and rem are considered relative bcz they are relative to the font-size of other elements
* em are relative to their parent's font-size
* font-size is an inherited property.so if you don't declare it anywhere.It's getting it from the     body(or the default which is normally 16px)

body {
    margin: 0;
    font-size: 10px;
    font-family: 'Lato', sans-serif;
    color: #2e354f;
}

.section-one {
    font-size: 20px;
}
ul {
    /* 1.5em = 150%  of it's parent's font size*/
    font-size: 1.5em; in this case ul's parent is .section-one so font-size will be 30px
}
