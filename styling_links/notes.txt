styling links:
................
make sure when styling links,people know that you can interact with them.It should be very obvious..

1.change the color on hover and focus
2.leave the text decoration on or if you turn it off make sure it's still obvious that it's alink
3.remember also include styles for :focus


we can change th style of a link like any other elements by using a simple elememt selector

a{
    color:#f30
}

links have different states that we can style as well 
default link state
:visited
:focus
:hover
:active
note:when styleing this states the order does matters
