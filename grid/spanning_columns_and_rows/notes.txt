spaning colums
---------------------------
instead of saying  grid-column: 1 / 2, we can use span like this
   grid-column: span 3;

we can also tell it's start line by default column and rows starts at the number 1
grid-column: 2 / span 2;:it's starting at line number 2 and spanning 2 columns wider
       
we can also do the same thing for rows too
grid-row: span 1;
