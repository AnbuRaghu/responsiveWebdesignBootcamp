.card-img {
    object-fit: cover;
    grid-row: 1 / 2;
    grid-column: 1 / -1;
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
}
in grid to set the image height and width issue, we cans set height and width as 100%,so that it sets the actual width and height of actual cell which they are
and for creating like padding kind of things we can use an empty column  an empty row like in this example
  grid-template: 200px 1em auto auto 100px 1em / 1em auto auto 1em;
  and if we want to span a grid items npt more than one column we can use like this
    grid-row: 5;
    grid-column: 2; we don't have to give 2nd value like  grid-row: 5/6; by default it span one column
