minmax and the fr unit
------------------------
when using grid,I tend to use fr a lot but we need to be careful with minmax()
because of how thr fr unit works,we cannot use it as the minimum size
we can't have fr as minimum size
grid-template-columns: 200px 200px minmax(1fr, 500px); it won't work

 grid-template-columns: 1fr minmax(200px, 1fr) 1fr; it works because fr is max value
