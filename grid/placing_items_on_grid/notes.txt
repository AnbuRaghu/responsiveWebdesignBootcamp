Placing items on the grid
Content will place itself automatically on the grid.
we can explicitely place items where we want them to be.

we can tell grid items exactly where they live within their parent's grid with the following properties
grid-column-start
grid-column-end
grid-row-start
grid-row-end

these 4 properties are placed on the grid items not on the parent
