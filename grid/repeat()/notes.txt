repear()
When defining our template-rows or template-columns if we have multiple columns that are the same width,we can use repeat()
This makes our lives easier and can be very useful with the fr unit to quickly make multiple columns that are all the same size.

first we define how many times we want to be reoeated and then the size.the two values must be comma seperated
for example,if we want to create a four column grid
example
display:grid;
grid-template-columns:repeat(4,300px)
