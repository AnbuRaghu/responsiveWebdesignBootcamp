implicit and explicit rows and columns
-----------------------------------------
when we declare display:grid on an element,all the grid items are automatically placed inside of a row,even if we haven't created any yet.
the dsame thing happens with the columns, though it will default to only have one column
when we set up grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows,we are explicitly stating how big the must be

sometimes columns and rows are created automatically
these are implicit rows and columns
but how big are these implicit rows and columns?
they'll default to auto(the width and height of the content)
if we want we can state how big we want them to be by using
grid-auto-rows
.grid-auto-columns
