similar to flexbox,when we create a new grid container,the flex children will fall onto the grid
the only real challange you'll see at first though,is that the msrgins no longer collapse.we have no dramatic making of columns like if we created a flex container

to properly use grid, we need to define rows and columns or atleast one of them
anytime we deal with grid-template-cplimn then we deal with the width of column, any time we deal with grid-template-row,we deal with height of the column

we can use a short hand property instead of saying grid-column-template,grid-column-row
body {
    display: grid;
    grid-template: 100px 400px / 250px 250px 250px;
    /* the first one is row 2nd one is column*/
}
