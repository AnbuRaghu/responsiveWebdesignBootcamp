to solve the problem with em, we can use rem:
-----------------------------------------------

The rem unit is short for Root Em
that means instead of being  relative to it's parent,it's alwasy relative to the'root' of our document.
The root of an html page is always the html element..it's better to use rem for font-sizes

so we can set our font size like this
html {
    font-size: 62.5%; this means 10px it's common to declare font-size as 62.5%
    but as per kevin leave the font-size of html by default whic means 100% by not declaring html{ fontsize:62.5% }
}

body {
    margin: 0;
    font-size: 1rem;// it's now 10px when we decare  html{ fontsize:62.5% },if we don't declare like this then font-size by default 16px
    font-family: 'Lato', sans-serif;
    color: #2e354f;
}

.section-one {
    font-size: 2rem;
}

ul {
    font-size: 1.5rem;
}

h1,
h2,
strong {
    font-weight: 900;
}

/* Typography */

h1 {
    font-size: 3rem;
    margin: 0;
}
